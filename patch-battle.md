## Welcome to the battle!

At the Chaos Communication Camp, Rosi introduced us to the concept of a "Patch Battle," a platform for teams to showcase their weapon of choice in a creative showdown. The ultimate question: Which creative tool reigns supreme in terms of speed and producing stunning results?

Only a fair competition can determine the victor. Thus, each team will designate a champion to step into the arena and vie for glory. Here are the rules:

## The rules
- The champions must come armed with their preferred hardware, ideally a notebook equipped with an HDMI output.
- The battle will consist of four rounds, each lasting 10 minutes.
- Each round will commence with a random prompt, such as "Circle and microphone" or "Cube Tunnel," challenging the champions' creativity.
- In each round, champions can earn points in three categories:
  - "**Fastest**" — A swift response with a shout of "Ready!" and quick keyboard skills.
  - "**Most beautiful**" — Audience applause and cheers will determine this category's winner.
  - "**Most elegant**" — Judges will consider factors like the efficiency of operations and the cleverness of the idea.
- The scores from each round will be tallied, and the ultimate champion will be announced.

## The date

The battle is planned for Saturday, Sep. 30th 2023 6pm at the [Deadline Party Berlin](https://deadline.untergrund.net/2023/events)
